# ðŸš— EV Adoption in Washington State â€” Data Visualization Final Project 
## Overview
We analyzed the Electric Vehicle (EV) population dataset from Washington State to explore adoption trends and provide insights that support sustainable transportation planning. Our analysis synthesizes course learnings in data pre-processing, and visual storytelling, showcasing a wide range of visual techniques to uncover actionable patterns in EV adoption.

## Motivation
* Climate Urgency: Transportation contributes over 25% of U.S. greenhouse gas emissions.
* Policy Drive: Washington aims to ban most gas-powered vehicle sales by 2030.
* Data Opportunity: Adoption patterns vary regionally; data helps align infrastructure and incentives with consumer behavior.

## Why This Dataset?
Washington is a national leader in EV adoption, driven by ambitious climate goals, diverse geography, and progressive legislation. Its rich datasetâ€”with over 230,000 EV recordsâ€”offers an ideal case for studying:

* Regional disparities in EV adoption
* Impact of clean fuel incentives
* Vehicle cost, type, and range preferences
* Brand and model dominance

## Visualizations Used:
We employed a variety of data visualization methods and tools including:
* Kepler.gl for interactive geospatial analysis
* Time-series line charts to track adoption over time
* Sankey and sunburst diagrams to highlight model and brand flows
* Violin plots and histograms to assess cost and range distributions
*  Choropleth maps to expose geographic disparities and policy eligibility

## Key Insights
* Urban Concentration: EV adoption is highest in urban counties (e.g., King, Snohomish), highlighting a need for rural infrastructure investment.
* Policy Effectiveness: Adoption spikes correlate with CAFV incentives.
* Range vs. Price: Battery Electric Vehicles (BEVs) offer greater range but are more expensive than Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicles (PHEVs).
* Brand Dominance: Tesla remains a top brand, with Model 3 leading in registrations.
* Visualization Innovation: Interactive and multi-layered charts enable deep-dive analysis beyond traditional dashboards.

## Future Recommendations
* Population-Normalized Metrics: Incorporating county-level population or vehicle registration data to reveal true regional disparities in EV adoption.
* Demographic Integration: Linking EV data with demographic factors (income, education, urban-rural classification) to enable more equitable policy interventions.
* Infrastructure Readiness: Assessing the availability of charging stations, electric utility coverage, and grid capacity to ensure regions are ready for increased EV demand.
* Temporal Forecasting: Using historical trends in registration, eligibility rates, and manufacturer growth to predict future EV adoption patterns under various policy scenarios.
* Goal: Improve the quality, equity, and forecasting of future EV adoption trends to inform more effective planning and policy decisions.
